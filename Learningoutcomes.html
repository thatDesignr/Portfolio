            <h4>New Marktplaast.nl UI/UX</h4>
            <p>In semester 2 I have made interactive media products that I have made with the program Figma. For
                example, I made a UI/UX overhaul of Marktplaats.nl</p>

            <h4>About the Marktplaats.nl UI/UX overhaul</h4>
            <p>The current Marktplaats UI/UX over the homepage looks old and has a bad UX. After doing research how
                other websites that sell goods and Marktplaats’ her competitors do, I have concluded a few
                things;<br><br>

                Many other websites have an advances search function, which the current Marktplaats side does not have.
                The current Marktplaats website shows notifications, even when not logged in, which does not make sense
                and is just confusing.<br><br>
                Besides those UX improvements, I also added the most sought/bought items at the top of the website with
                so users do not have to search for them.<br><br>

                I also improved the look of the UI, while staying in the same layout, so existing users are not confused
                by the changes. </p>

                universities/schools that I have concluded a few things; <br<br>

                    The costs are not on the website
                    Users cant find the times they will be attending the classes

                    With these user feedbacks I remade the UI/UX of the website. Once I finished this, I did user tests
                    to find out what users think of the new website. With this feedback I have made new versions. Check
                    out the user feedback below:</p>

            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>I am completely new to front-end development, so I have explored HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop
                websites. The first website I coded is the website you are currently viewing. I have learned what each
                languages does and I know when to use them: <br><br>HTML: Defines the structure and content of web
                pages.<br>
                CSS Controls the visual presentation and layout of web pages.<br>
                JavaScript Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.</p>
            <h4 style="padding-top:40px;">Documentation</h4>
            <p>Documentation in web development serves as a crucial roadmap for developers, offering clear instructions,
                explanations, and examples on how to use, maintain, and extend code. It enhances collaboration among
                team members, ensures consistency in coding practices, and facilitates easier onboarding of new
                developers. Additionally, comprehensive documentation fosters better understanding of the project for
                stakeholders and clients, leading to improved communication and more effective decision-making.</p>

            <h4>Version Control History Environment</h4>
            <p>Version control history is important because it provides a detailed record of changes made to a codebase
                over time. It allows developers to track the evolution of a project, understand who made specific
                changes, and revert to previous versions if necessary. Additionally, version control history facilitates
                collaboration among team members by providing insights into the development process and ensuring
                consistency across code contributions.</p>

            <h4 style=>GitHub</h4>
            <p>To record changes I made to code I use GitHub.com and GitHub Desktop. Each time I made changes I pushed
                these to the main branch of the repository with a clear title so its easy for other people to understand
                what the change is about.</p>

            <h4>SoundLab Branding</h4>
            <p>We got asked to create a new brand identity for SoundLab of Fontys. I made various visual works like
                a new logo design, a brand identity, a new name, and a poster. Each design is iteratively designed
                in professional design tools like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Indesign, and Figma.</p>
            <h4>Stylescape</h4>
            <p>The first thing I did was make a stylescape of the new SoundLab. I went with a corporate style with a
                purple theme in all media expressions. The circles should be visible in all media experssions, which
                represent sound waves. Everyone like this stylescape, but the client said it was too corporate. The
                client wanted something playful, so we went with a space theme for the new SoundLab.</p>

                    <p>Feedback: The poster itself is very nice, but I miss the “sound”. It’s too much “space”. The
                        title is a bit misleading; not all sound recordings are perfect. The text is too small, I
                        recommend to delete it, because no one is going to read that anyway.</p>

                    <p>In the second version I added a big microphone to emphasize its a studio to record sounds and
                        voice. I changed the title to something more realistic and made the word “sound” more playful.
                        The planet is also smaller so “sound” and “space” are more evenly weighed in the poster.</p>
