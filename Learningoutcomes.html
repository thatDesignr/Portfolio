            <p>In semester 2 I have made interactive media products that I have made with the program Figma. For
                example, I made a UI/UX overhaul of Marktplaats.nl</p>

            <h4>About the Marktplaats.nl UI/UX overhaul</h4>
            <p>The current Marktplaats UI/UX over the homepage looks old and has a bad UX. After doing research how
                other websites that sell goods and Marktplaats’ her competitors do, I have concluded a few
                things;<br><br>

                Many other websites have an advances search function, which the current Marktplaats side does not have.
                The current Marktplaats website shows notifications, even when not logged in, which does not make sense
                and is just confusing.<br><br>
                Besides those UX improvements, I also added the most sought/bought items at the top of the website with
                so users do not have to search for them.<br><br>

                I also improved the look of the UI, while staying in the same layout, so existing users are not confused
                by the changes. </p>

                    With these user feedbacks I remade the UI/UX of the website. Once I finished this, I did user tests
                    to find out what users think of the new website. With this feedback I have made new versions. Check

            <h4>Fontys OVP Easter Egg</h4>
            <p>We developed the front-end in a group together with Levi and Hein. The challenge of the project was to
                implement an easteregg in to the website. </p>

                <img src="img/Easteregg.png">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>This was a fun project to do, because web design and front-end development is what I really like to do. I
                learned alot from researching the bottlenecks of the previous OVP website to design a better website.
                Working together with my peers on 1 landing page was challenging, but in the end I think we did well.

            <h4>My portfolio</h4>
            <p>To showcase my work and describe my learning outcomes, I also made an interactive portfolio. I started of
                with doing research on design trends and look for inspiration.</p>
            <img src="img/PortfolioResearch.png">
            <h4>Style of the website</h4>
            <p>It was important to me that the portfolio looked modern, and like a front-end development portfolio. To
                achieve this, I focused on making my portfolio look modern and reflect the style of a front-end
                development portfolio. I experimented with various interactive components and cutting-edge design
                trends, integrating them to create an engaging and visually appealing user experience. This process not
                only enhanced the look and feel of my work but also helped me connect more effectively with users
                through innovative design. </p>
            <img src="img/Portoflio Showcase.png">
            <h4>Responsiveness</h4>
            <p>In todays time its very important to have a responsive website due to the vast majority of different
                operating systems and screen sizes. If you want to view the Figma of my portfolio you can click the
                button below.</p>

            <h4>Project X</h4>
            <p>For my personal project called "TradersFolio" I worked on a landing page for my own company that I have
                been building for almost half a year now.</p>
            <img src="img/TradersFolio.png">
            <h4>Research</h4>
            <p>Before starting with the design of the landing page in Figma, I did competitor research on other projects
                that offer the same or similar product(s), to understand what I should put on the landing page. You can
                view this research by clicking the button below:</p>

                <h4>Design Inspiration</h4>
            <p>After I finished the competitor research I started with looking for design inspiration and researching
                current design trends.</p>
            <img src="img/TradersFolioResearch.png">
            <h4>Design</h4>
            <p>I found out it is very important to showcase your product as clearly as possible on the hero, because
                most people do not read and actually click away if they can't find any information in a few seconds.
                That is why I decided to make an animation in Adobe After effects to showcase the dashboard.</p>
            <img src="img/AfterEffectsAnimation.gif">
            <h4>Multi language website</h4>
            <p>Because the target audience also includes a quite big group of people that live in countries that are not
                good at speaking and understanding English (Russia and Spanish speaking countries), I included a
                dropdown to translate the full website to make the website more user friendly.</p>

            <h2>Development and Version Control</h2>
            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>I am completely new to front-end development, so I have explored HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop
                websites. The first website I coded is the website you are currently viewing. I have learned what each
                languages does and I know when to use them: <br><br>HTML: Defines the structure and content of web
                pages.<br>
                CSS: Controls the visual presentation and layout of web pages.<br>
                JavaScript: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.</p>
            <h4 style="padding-top:40px;">Documentation</h4>
            <p>Documentation in web development serves as a crucial roadmap for developers, offering clear instructions,
                explanations, and examples on how to use, maintain, and extend code. It enhances collaboration among
                team members, ensures consistency in coding practices, and facilitates easier onboarding of new
                developers. Additionally, comprehensive documentation fosters better understanding of the project for
                stakeholders and clients, leading to improved communication and more effective decision-making.</p>

            <h4>Version Control History Environment</h4>
            <p>Version control history is important because it provides a detailed record of changes made to a codebase
                over time. It allows developers to track the evolution of a project, understand who made specific
                changes, and revert to previous versions if necessary. Additionally, version control history facilitates
                collaboration among team members by providing insights into the development process and ensuring
                consistency across code contributions.</p>
            <h4>GitHub</h4>
            <p>To record changes I made to code I use GitHub.com and GitHub Desktop. Each time I made changes I pushed
                these to the main branch of the repository with a clear title so its easy for other people to understand
                what the change is about.</p>

            <p>Because I did this project together with Levi and Hein, we worked in Github. Everyone had their own
                branch where we would pull, commit and merge. This was very challenging to do because it always produced
                conflicts and errors. In the end we learned alot from it about how to work together. For example what we
                did wrong was not make a general stylesheet for things that are always the same like text sizes, fonts,
                colors, etc. Also, everyone codes in a different style, for example some like to use sections instead of
                divs, some used percentages instead of pixels, and some use grids where others don't. This made the
                whole website a mess, but for next time we know that before we start coding we need to make agreements.

            <h4>Development of my portfolio</h4>
            <p>The portfolio you are currently viewing is a showcase of my development and design skills, but also a way
                to show and describe my learning outcomes.</p>
            <img style="width: 200px;" src="img/Repo Overview.png">
            <h4>Version control</h4>
            <p>It was important to me to make a Github repo where I can easily view my changes and progress, so I can
                always go a step back incase something breaks. I keep this Github regulary updated when I made changes
                to the website.</p>

            <h4>Read me file</h4>
            <p>For my portfolio I also made a read me file. A README file is essential because it provides an overview
                of the project, guides users on setup and usage, documents features and structure, encourages
                collaboration by outlining contribution guidelines, and enhances the project's professionalism and
                credibility.</p>

            <h2>Iterative Design</h2>
            <h4>SoundLab Branding</h4>
            <p>We got asked to create a new brand identity for SoundLab of Fontys. I made various visual works like
                a new logo design, a brand identity, a new name, and a poster. Each design is iteratively designed
                in professional design tools like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Indesign, and Figma.</p>
            <h4>Stylescape</h4>
            <p>The first thing I did was make a stylescape of the new SoundLab. I went with a corporate style with a
                purple theme in all media expressions. The circles should be visible in all media experssions, which
                represent sound waves. Everyone like this stylescape, but the client said it was too corporate. The
                client wanted something playful, so we went with a space theme for the new SoundLab.</p>

                        recommend to delete it, because no one is going to read that anyway.</p>

                        voice. I changed the title to something more realistic and made the word “sound” more playful.
                        The planet is also smaller so “sound” and “space” are more evenly weighed in the poster.</p>

            <h4>Fontys OVP</h4>
            <p>
                We got asked to redesign the landing page of Fontys OVP, because it was very outdated and has a bad User
                Experience. The goal of this project was to increase the students for Fontys Onderwijs voor
                Professionals. We started with researching the current website to see what is wrong with it. After this
                we made a new design in Figma. We did user tests to see what users think of the new design. With this
                feedback we made new versions of the design. The final design can be seen below:
            </p>
            <img src="/img/revisions ovp website.png" alt="Revisions OVP Website">
            <p>This the first version of the UI/UX design. On the right is the second and final version I made after
                getting valuable feedback from various people like peers, teachers and other professionals. </p>
            <img src="/img/Nav bar 1.png">
            <p>In the first version of the nav bar, I included a handy dropdown to translate the web page to different
                languages for internatoinal students. However, after talking to a teacher, I found out OVP only offers
                lessons in Dutch, so I removed the drop down language menu to prevent confusion. </p>
            <img src="/img/Nav bar 2.png">
            <p>In the second versiion I removed the dropdown menu and moved the navigation to the right. According to
                the teacher this was a better nav bar.</p>
            <h4>No Lorem Ipsum</h4>
            <p>After presenting my work to the class, the client and Paul, I got some valuable feedback to not use Lorem
                Ipsum text to fill up space.</p>
            <img src="img/Lorem Ipsum 2.png">
            <p>In the first version I used lorem ipsum text which made it unclear to the client and teacher what the
                field were about.</p>
            <img src="img/Lorem Ipsum 1.png">
            <p>In the second version, I used real text.</p>
            <h4>My Portfolio</h4>
            <p>My portfolio has seen many iterations. At the first portfolio review I imeaditally started of designing
                the website in Figma. I got feedback from Paul to start of with a wireframe.</p>
            <img src="img/portfolio figma.png">
            <p>After the wireframe I started designing the website in Figma. I got feedback from Paul to make the
                website more personal and to add more images of my work.</p>
            <img src="img/first portfolio.png">
            <p>The first portfolio website design was a bit boring and lacked personality. In the second version I made
                sure it looked like a development portfolio.</p>
            <img src="img/Portoflio Showcase.png">
            <p>In the second version I made a portfolio that looks more like a front-end development & design portfolio.
            </p>
            <h4>Navigation</h4>
            <p>On the learning outcomes page I included a navigation dropdown for all learning outcomes. However, after
                some feedback from a few teachers I got told this isn't good because when you click on one learning
                outcome, it scrolls down and then you have scroll all the way back up to find the navigation again.</p>
            <img src="img/navigation.png">
            <p>I made a new version where you can hover over the dropdown, select one, then it automatically scrolls
                down but stays at the top of the viewport for a good user experience.</p>
            <h4>TradersFolio Website</h4>
            <p>For project X I made alot of iterations for the landing page. You can view these in the Figma file below.

            <h4>Feedback from clients, peers and professionals</h4>
            <p>In semester 2 I have worked on 2 different projects. Each had a client which I often had contact with in
                person or on Teams. If the client has feedback, I wrote this down, so I could take a look at it later. I
                used this feedback to make my media products better. </p>
            <h4>Career day</h4>
            <p>On April 18th I went to the career day hosted at Strijp-TQ. Eventhough I already know in which direction
                I want to go in this study and when working for clients, I thought it would be fun to take a look which
                type of companies there are in my field.</p>

            <h4 style="padding-top:30px;">Identifying my own core values</h4>
            <p>Thinking about what's important to me in my studies and work, I've figured out a few things that really
                matter. I discovered these by looking at myself and my experiences.
                <br><br>
                One big moment was during my second semester as an ICT media & design student. I was doing projects that
                mixed design and front-end coding. Doing these projects made me realize how much I care about being
                creative, solving problems, and working well with others.
                <br><br>
                So, after some thinking, I found some values that are super important to me. Being creative is a big
                one. It drives me to think in new ways and make things that look good and work well. I also really value
                teamwork. I think we can do amazing things when we work together and support each other. And being
                honest and doing things well is really important too.
                <br><br>
                These values guide me in my studies, career, and work. In my studies, they push me to take on
                challenging projects with my classmates and make sure we all work together well. For example, when I
                work with three other students, I make sure we talk openly, respect each other, and all do our part.
                <br><br>
                For my career, these values help me choose jobs that match what I believe in and let me make a positive
                difference. Whether it's making cool designs, coming up with new tech ideas, or making sure things are
                done right, my values guide my choices.
                <br><br>
                When I work with clients, like teachers I've worked with before, I focus on understanding what they
                need, being honest, and doing my best work. By sticking to my values, I hope to not just do well, but
                also make make the client happy.
