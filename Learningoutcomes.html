            <p>In semester 2 I have made interactive media products that I have made with the program Figma. For

            <h4>About the Marktplaats.nl UI/UX overhaul</h4>
            <p>The current Marktplaats UI/UX over the homepage looks old and has a bad UX. After doing research how
                other websites that sell goods and Marktplaats’ her competitors do, I have concluded a few
                things;<br><br>

                Many other websites have an advances search function, which the current Marktplaats side does not have.
                The current Marktplaats website shows notifications, even when not logged in, which does not make sense
                and is just confusing.<br><br>
                Besides those UX improvements, I also added the most sought/bought items at the top of the website with
                so users do not have to search for them.<br><br>

                I also improved the look of the UI, while staying in the same layout, so existing users are not confused
                by the changes. </p>

            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>I am completely new to front-end development, so I have explored HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop
                websites. The first website I coded is the website you are currently viewing. I have learned what each
                languages does and I know when to use them: <br><br>HTML: Defines the structure and content of web
                pages.<br>
                CSS Controls the visual presentation and layout of web pages.<br>
                JavaScript Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.</p>
            <h4 style="padding-top:40px;">Documentation</h4>
            <p>Documentation in web development serves as a crucial roadmap for developers, offering clear instructions,
                explanations, and examples on how to use, maintain, and extend code. It enhances collaboration among
                team members, ensures consistency in coding practices, and facilitates easier onboarding of new
                developers. Additionally, comprehensive documentation fosters better understanding of the project for
                stakeholders and clients, leading to improved communication and more effective decision-making.</p>

            <h4>Version Control History Environment</h4>
            <p>Version control history is important because it provides a detailed record of changes made to a codebase
                over time. It allows developers to track the evolution of a project, understand who made specific
                changes, and revert to previous versions if necessary. Additionally, version control history facilitates
                collaboration among team members by providing insights into the development process and ensuring
                consistency across code contributions.</p>

            <h4 style=>GitHub</h4>
            <p>To record changes I made to code I use GitHub.com and GitHub Desktop. Each time I made changes I pushed
                these to the main branch of the repository with a clear title so its easy for other people to understand
                what the change is about.</p>

            <h4>SoundLab Branding</h4>
            <p>We got asked to create a new brand identity for SoundLab of Fontys. I made various visual works like
                a new logo design, a brand identity, a new name, and a poster. Each design is iteratively designed
                in professional design tools like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Indesign, and Figma.</p>
            <h4>Stylescape</h4>
            <p>The first thing I did was make a stylescape of the new SoundLab. I went with a corporate style with a
                purple theme in all media expressions. The circles should be visible in all media experssions, which
                represent sound waves. Everyone like this stylescape, but the client said it was too corporate. The
                client wanted something playful, so we went with a space theme for the new SoundLab.</p>

                        title is a bit misleading; not all sound recordings are perfect. The text is too small, I
                        recommend to delete it, because no one is going to read that anyway.</p>

                        voice. I changed the title to something more realistic and made the word “sound” more playful.
                        The planet is also smaller so “sound” and “space” are more evenly weighed in the poster.</p>

            <h4>Feedback from clients, peers and professionals</h4>
            <p>In semester 2 I have worked on 2 different projects. Each had a client which I often had contact with in
                person or on Teams. If the client has feedback, I wrote this down, so I could take a look at it later. I
                used this feedback to make my designs better.</p>
            <h4 style="padding-top:30px;">Identifying my own core values</h4>
            <p>Thinking about what's important to me in my studies and work, I've figured out a few things that really
                matter. I discovered these by looking at myself and my experiences.
                <br><br>
                One big moment was during my second semester as an ICT media & design student. I was doing projects that
                mixed design and front-end coding. Doing these projects made me realize how much I care about being
                creative, solving problems, and working well with others.
                <br><br>
                So, after some thinking, I found some values that are super important to me. Being creative is a big
                one. It drives me to think in new ways and make things that look good and work well. I also really value
                teamwork. I think we can do amazing things when we work together and support each other. And being
                honest and doing things well is really important too.
                <br><br>
                These values guide me in my studies, career, and work. In my studies, they push me to take on
                challenging projects with my classmates and make sure we all work together well. For example, when I
                work with three other students, I make sure we talk openly, respect each other, and all do our part.
                <br><br>
                For my career, these values help me choose jobs that match what I believe in and let me make a positive
                difference. Whether it's making cool designs, coming up with new tech ideas, or making sure things are
                done right, my values guide my choices.

                When I work with clients, like teachers I've worked with before, I focus on understanding what they
                need, being honest, and doing my best work. By sticking to my values, I hope to not just do well, but
                also make make the client happy.
